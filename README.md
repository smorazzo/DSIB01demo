Practicals 3

I missed this class. Daniel alter helped me follow the class from the PDF.

Assessing quality control in fastqc program
reads1 file, 
with no sequences flagged as poor quality
per base content with yellow warning, and also overrepresented sequences

reads2 file
with no seqeunces flagged as poor quality
overepresented sequences with yellow warning

Then we applied trimming, using cutadapt
the results of the trimmed files are
reads 1 trimmmed
yellow warning remained for per base content and overrepresented sequences, and a new one in sequence length

reads2 trimmed
yellow warning remained for overrepresented sequences, new one in sequence length distribution and a red one in perbase seqeunce content
